To automatically change your Kali Linux IP address every minute and revert to a valid IP address after a system restart, you can use a Python script in conjunction with the subprocess module to execute shell commands. Please note that changing IP addresses frequently and using invalid IP addresses may have unintended consequences, so proceed with caution. Here's an example code snippet:

python
Copy code
import subprocess
import time

def change_ip_address():
    # Obtain current IP address details
    ip_info = subprocess.run(['ifconfig', 'eth0'], capture_output=True, text=True)
    current_ip = ip_info.stdout.split('\n')[1].split()[1][5:]

    # Generate a new random IP address
    new_ip = '192.168.0.' + str(random.randint(1, 255))

    # Change the IP address
    subprocess.run(['ifconfig', 'eth0', new_ip, 'netmask', '255.255.255.0', 'up'])
    print(f'Changed IP address from {current_ip} to {new_ip}')

while True:
    change_ip_address()
    time.sleep(60)
Save this script as ip_changer.py. To automatically run this script on system startup, you can add it to your system's startup services. Here's an example for systemd:

Create a systemd unit file:

bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/ip-changer.service
Add the following content to the file:

csharp
Copy code
[Unit]
Description=IP Changer Service
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /path/to/ip_changer.py

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
Replace /path/to/ip_changer.py with the actual path to your ip_changer.py script.

Save the file and exit the text editor.

Enable the service:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl enable ip-changer.service
This will make the script run on system startup.

After following these steps, your Kali Linux system will automatically execute the Python script every minute, changing the IP address accordingly.
